# NECT-Project
Network and Cloud Technology (NECT) project covered the theoretical and practical aspects of network and cloud technology. Topics covered include how data is transmitted within an organisation and via the internet, as well as cloud computing technologies, its benefits, organisation, cloud usage, and risks.


My NECT consisted of 2 components;
 1) NECT Case study 
 2) NECT Project


--------------------------

### 1) NECT Case Study

#### Network Implementation
  ##### Logical Topology
  
  - 3-level smart home.
  - Main router placed on the 2nd floor for maximum coverage.
  - Backup router included for redundancy.
  
  ##### IoT & AWS Integration
  
  - IoT devices (Webcams, Smart Doors, Solar Panel) connected via home gateway → AWS S3 Glacier.
  - Remote control of devices via smartphones.
  - Smart doors and cameras installed for physical and data security.
  - Renewable energy integration via solar panels.
  
  ##### Routers & Access Points
  - Used access points on Level 2 to avoid router overload.
  - Switched to mesh routers instead of multiple routers for seamless coverage and reduced latency.
  
  ##### Switches
  - Added switches for faster local data transfer and improved efficiency.
  
  ##### Password Security
  - Enforced strong passwords (≥8 characters, mixed symbols/numbers).
  
  ##### Cloud Printing
  - Configured Google Cloud Print for easy document sharing and remote access.


#### Cloud Services & AWS Security
  ##### Amazon VPC
  
  - Created a Virtual Private Cloud for secure, isolated networking.
  - Benefits: device isolation, bandwidth optimization, improved privacy.
  
  ##### Amazon S3
  
  - Used for scalable, centralized storage of IoT data, camera recordings, and family files.
  - Security features: ACLs, server-side encryption, controlled access.
  
  ##### AWS IAM
  
  - Defined fine-grained access policies.
  - Managed users/groups for household access.
  - Enabled auditing and logging for accountability.
  
  ##### Amazon Cognito
  
  - Added MFA and OAuth 2.0 for secure authentication.
  - Allowed user synchronization across devices.
  - Provided customizable login workflows.

#### Sustainability Proposals
  Shubham
  - Energy-Efficient Ethernet (EEE) for reduced power consumption.
  - Promoted high device density to optimize resource usage.
  - Opted for mesh routers over multiple routers for efficiency.
  - Suggested network virtualization to reduce hardware footprint.

  - Recommended Wi-Fi optimization and dynamic routing protocols for energy savings.
  
  Tevian
  - Proposed Energy-Efficient Switches for dynamic power savings.
  - Suggested a low-energy entertainment center with smart TVs and power strips.
  
  Xin Yu
  - Suggested automatic timers for AC units and IoT devices.
  - Added solar panels for renewable energy contribution.
  - Upgraded networking devices to Energy Star certified models.
  
  Yi Jie
  - Implemented Edge Computing to process data locally, reducing bandwidth use.
  - Suggested low-power IoT protocols (e.g., Zigbee) for efficient communication.

  #### References
  - Key sources included AWS documentation, energy-efficient device research, and IoT/smart home best practices.

  #### Conclusion
  - This project successfully demonstrated:
  - A secure smart home network architecture.
  - Integration of IoT with AWS services.
  - Strong focus on cybersecurity, cloud authentication, and encryption.
    Sustainable energy strategies to minimize environmental impact.
